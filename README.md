# Book Title Inspiration

If you need a title for a book or paper in a certain gengre this tool might give you some inspiration.
Brainstorming titles can be can be hard and to find the title you like it is sometimes better
to know what you don't want. :)


## What the tool should do

Get the top X (10-1000) book titles from Amazon.
These titles can be used to mark suggested titles as not available.

Based on the title get a list of words and create random titles from that list.
There might be a way to add words to the list.

I like to generate german titles. A certain structure of the titles and some meta info about the word
might be helpful.
